# 3D Solar System Simulation

A simulation of the solar system in 3D, created using OpenGL and C++. This project includes customizable textures, adjustable planetary motions, and detailed visualizations of planets and moons.

---

## Features

1. **3D Planetary Simulation**:
   - Simulates a solar system with planets and moons, including their orbits and rotations.

2. **Custom Texture Application**:
   - Apply custom textures to planets using the SOIL library for realistic appearances.

3. **Adjustable Speeds**:
   - Modify the rotation and orbit speeds of planets and moons for better visualization.

4. **Enhanced Graphics**:
   - Replace default spheres with `GLUquadricObj` spheres for smoother rendering.

## Tools and Technologies Used

1. **OpenGL**:
   - For rendering the 3D solar system and animations.

2. **SOIL (Simple OpenGL Image Library)**:
   - Used for image loading and texture management.

3. **C++**:
   - The programming language for implementing logic and rendering.

4. **GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)**:
   - Facilitates window management and user interactions.

## How to Run

1. Set up the SOIL library as instructed in the project files.
2. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler with OpenGL and GLUT dependencies.
3. Run the executable and enjoy the solar system simulation.

## Customization Instructions

1. Replace default textures with your own images by updating the texture files.
2. Adjust planetary speeds and rotations in the code (`rotatespeed`, `moonrotaterate`, etc.).
3. Modify display parameters to create a unique solar system layout.
